# Patient Summary Generator

This application leverages ChatGPT to generate patient summaries efficiently. It integrates Gemini for robust text generation capabilities and is developed using Vertex AI, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can begin editing the functionality by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The application auto-updates as you make changes.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for automatic optimization and loading of fonts, including Inter, a custom Google Font.
